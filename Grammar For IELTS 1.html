        <ul style="font-size:28px">  <li>I really enjoyed reading Aldous Huxley’s ‘Brave New World’ and one scene in particular comes to mind. Two of the characters, Linda and her son John, are taken from the place where they are living, to London.  This is the ‘brave new world’ and ideals of love, and family life are despised. Because Linda looks old and unattractive she is given a drug called ‘soma’ in the hope that she will die. Eventually, John gets a phone call and is told his mum is dying in hospital. He rushes to her bedside and sits there watching over her. He remembers how she used to be when she was younger but a group of children spoil the moment when they start making fun of Linda. This event is really important because it shows the difference between the old and the new world. Even the nurse can’t understand why John is unhappy when his mum dies.</li></ul>
